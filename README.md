# Intro-to-SpringBoot-1
This hands-on experience is the first of a 2-part series that will prepare software engineering students for classes like ECSE 321 and ECSE 428, and will provide everyone with the foundations to build a proper application. No experience with Gradle or Spring Boot is needed, however some experience in Java is recommended.
